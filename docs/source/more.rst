Future Works
------------

- Support exporting prompts which can be used in the task of time-series image segmentation
- Support other SAM-related models, such as `HQ-SAM <https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq>`_, `FastSAM <https://github.com/coolzhao/Geo-SAM/issues/15>`_, `MobileSAM <https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM>`_ and so on.
- Support labeling large objects across patches
- Add video tutorials for installation and usage
